        <p id="pp">Hi! My name is Sophia and I am a Sophomore at Summit Preparatory Charter High School. I have made this website for my computer science elective class. I'm really excited to be taking this class because before this, I did not have much knowledge about computer science, and I like trying new things. Because I enjoy experiencing new things often, one of my passions in life is travel. I have been to a total of six different countries: England, Spain, Italy, China, Canada and Mexico and hope to visit many more in my lifetime. My favorite thing about traveling is experiencing and being immersed in other cultures. Most of the places I have been have been spots that have so much history that is really interesting to learn about.
            <br>
            <br>Along with my interests of adventure and travel, I also enjoy playing volleyball and hanging out with my friends. I play volleyball for my school team as the setter. I find it really fun to be able to play with my friends of my grade and people from different grades too. Since I do not play club volleyball, I really value the short season and practice times that I have to be able to enjoy one of my favorite sports. When I'm not playing volleyball, you can usually find me hanging out with my friends. I'm not sure what I would do without my friends to make me laugh, cheer me up, and give me good advice. They're some of my favorite people in the world besides my family. I met most of my best friends at Summit however, a lot of them I grew up with either at my old school or from church when I was younger.
            <br>
            <br>One of my hobbies is horseback riding. In my free time I like to visit my horse, who is boarded in Portola Valley. I have made friends with some of the people at the ranch and have since been riding the trails with them when I have the time. My grandpa grew up on a ranch and has owned horses all of his life, so when he moved from his last ranch to a regular sized house, he gave me his horse. If he hadn't given me his horse, I definitely wouldn't have one right now, because buying one is just so expensive. I really enjoy riding because I feel like it's a way to get to know my grandpa and what he enjoys doing as well.
