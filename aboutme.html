    <p class="pp"> Hi! My name is Sophia and I am a Sophomore at Summit Preparatory Charter High School.  I have made this website for my  <br> computer science elective class. 
        I'm really excited to be taking this class because before this, I did not have much knowledge about<br> Computer Science, and I like trying new things.
    Because I enjoy experiencing new things often, one of my hobbies and passions in life<br> is travel.  I have been to a total of six different countries:
    England, Spain, Italy, China, Canada and Mexico and hope to visit many more <br> in my lifetime.  My favorite thing about traveling is experiencing and being submersed
    in other cultures.  Most of the places I have been <br> have been spots that have so much history that is really interesting to learn about.</p>
    <p class="pp"> Along with my interests of adventure and travel, I also enjoy playing volleyball, riding my horse, and hanging out with my friends.  I  <br> play volleyball
    for my school team as the setter.  I find it really fun to be able to play with my friends of my grade and people from <br> different grades too!  In my free time I like
    to visit my horse, who is boarded in Portola Valley.  I have made friends with some of the <br> people at the ranch and have since been riding the trails with them when I
    have the time.  One of my favorite things to do is hang out <br> with my friends.  We usually go to each other's houses and just hang out, go out to eat, or go to the mall or movies.
