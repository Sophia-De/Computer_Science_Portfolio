            <td class="woahthere">HTML stands for <strong><u>H</u></strong>yper<strong><u>T</u></strong>ext <strong><u>M</u></strong>arkup <strong><u>L</u></strong>anguage and is the most commonly used markup language today. HTML is used to create different things on the computer, such as this webpage. HTML elements are written beginning and ending with a start tag, which tells the program what it is supposed to be creating. The content goes between the start tags and is shown on the page that you are creating, while the start tags do not show up on the screen. HTML elements can be nested within other HTML elements. This means that there can be multiple tags under one larger tag. For example, when writing the content for a webpage, you always start with an html tag at the beginning and the end of the HTML document. Inside of those tags, you include other tags that you want to be the content within your page. HTML was created by a man named Tim Berners-Lee (pictured below). HTML is a fairly new concept. It was introduced along with the World Wide Web because HTML was the World Wide Web's publishing language. HTML and the World Wide Web came about at CERN, a meeting place for physicists all over the world where highly intellegent and creative groups of thinkers engage in discussions of many complex ideas. Tim Berners-Lee was working on a computer services section of CERN when he came up with the idea for the Web.

            <td class="woahthere">Tags are hidden words in the HTML document that tells the browser what needs to be done in order to display your content the way you want it to. Without tags, nothing on this page would show up how it looks now! All tags have an opening tag and a closing tag, to show the browser where the information in that section starts and ends. You write a tag first by adding the &#60; symbol to tell the browser that you are going to be starting a new tag. Next, you write the word of the tag that you want to make. You close the opening tag with the &#62; symbol. Then, you write the information that you want inside of that and close it with a closing tag. To write the closing tag, you do the &#60; symbol and add a / in order to tell the browser that you're ending. Then, you add the closing symbol &#62; in order to show that you are done with the whole tag. Here are four tags and descriptions about them:
                <ul>
                    <li>&#60;p&#62; . . . &#60;/p&#62; : This tag is the paragraph tag. Whenever you want to write information in a paragraph format, you use this tag. When you add a paragraph tag under another paragraph tag, it will automatically set them up on different lines.</li>
                    <li>&#60;u&#62; . . . &#60;/u&#62; : This tag is the underline tag. When you want to <u>underline</u> only a couple specific words in a sentence or paragraph and you don't want to add a class or ID in order to do that. You just wrap the word or letter that you want to underline in this tag in order to get the underline look.
                    </li>
                    <li>&#60;h1&#62; . . . &#60;/h1&#62; : This tag is the heading tag. It's used for when you need a heading for a page that you are making. It comes with a preset size in order to show that it is a heading. However, you can also change the properties of it later on by using CSS.</li>
                    <li>&#60;strong&#62; . . . &#60;/strong&#62; : This tag is the strong, or bold, tag. This tag is used when you only want to <strong>bold</strong> a couple words or less in a sentence and you don't want to add a class or ID in order to do that. You would just wrap the word or letter you wish to bold in this tag in order to get that effect.</li>
                </ul>

           <td class="woahthere">CSS stands for <strong><u>C</u></strong>ascading <strong><u>S</u></strong>tyle <strong><u>S</u></strong>heet. CSS is used to make HTML look more pleasing to the eye. You can do simple things with CSS, such as change the background color and font of the text. However, you can also do more complex things with CSS, such as have something rotate or move when you click it or hover over it. CSS can be used in HTML by adding a "style" element to it or by creating a separate "style" sheet and linking it to the HTML document. You can use CSS by adding tags to your elements on the HTML document, or by specifying which large element you wish to change. CSS was invented by the World Wide Web Consortium, which is a group of people/company work together to develop new web standards. They created CSS as a way to make the web more organized and accessible in 1996. You write CSS by adding a style and then using tags in order to tell the program what you want it to do. You can use tags such as "bacground-color:blue;" and "text-align:center;".

            </td>  
            <td class="woahthere">Attributes are used in HTML in order to provide extra information about the HTML element that you want to add something to.  For example, you can use the "href" tag in order to add a link to one of the elements on your HTML document.  Attributes are always found in the start tag and use quotation marks to specify what you want to change.  Other attributes can be "height", "width", and "alt" in order to change your picture or have a backup text in case your picture doesn't show up on a certain browser.<img alt="This is a picture showing where the tags, attributes and values are found" class="tim" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_A8ddo0sljwY/TN6a5KHhvPI/AAAAAAAAAoM/7IKwR5Hbj6k/s1600/attribute.png">
