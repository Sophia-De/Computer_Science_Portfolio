                <p class="ppp">This is the RAM. RAM stands for Random Access Memory. The RAM contains different bytes of memory that can be accessed separately without accessing other bytes. It stores memory for the computer and also allows you to go back and look at
                    it as well. Accessing memory on the RAM is much quicker than on a CD or hard drive because the memory is not organized in an ordered way.</p>

                <p class="ppp">This is the hard drive. A hard drive is used to permanently store information, but it also allows you to go back and look over the information that you wished to permanently store. It contains different disks inside of it where it stores
                    different information about the computer. One section could contain pictures, documents, music, and videos, while another may contain the programming belonging to your computer.</p>

                <p class="ppp">So how does the computer communicate to other functioning parts? Different components of the computer communicate with one another by using something called a bus. A bus is able to connect various components over the same set of wires.
                    An internal bus is the thing that connects all of the insides of the computer components together. However, you can also use an external bus in order to connect other computers and external hard drives as well.</p>

                <p class="ppp">The keyboard is rows of keys that operate the computer or laptop that you are on. A computer mouse is a device that controls the cursor on the computer, allowing you to select things you want to do on your personal computer. A monitor
                    is the screen part of the computer. The monitor displays everything that the computer is allowing you to see. Everything that you do on a computer, without taking it apart, has to be controlled by using the keyboard, mouse or monitor.</p>
