            My bot ended up doing exactly what I wanted it to do. However, the code was a little complicated for me to create because I had no previous experience with Artificial Intelligence before, so it was all new to me. My understanding of Artificial Intelligence
            has deepened greatly because we were able to get a hands on experience from help with our teacher. By being able to see how my bot worked on the screen, I began to understand what it was that the program was telling it to do and see it play
            out in front of me. This was cool because I was able to learn a simpler form of Artificial Intelligence and, in the end, was able to understand a complex idea through it. Read the description I have found about Artificial Intelligence below
            to find out more.
